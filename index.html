     <div class="container1"></div>
		<p> I have spent the last decade forming a considerable set of skills and knowledge relating to the fields of clincal cardiology and business.
			Having started my career as a student clinical physiologist and completing my degree programme over a 4 year period, I swifty moved into industry and help set up a direct to market service as part of ST Jude Medicals initial team
			delivering CRM solutions to the Irish market in 2015. St Jude Medical was aquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2017 where I initially retained my position before being promoted to territory manager covering the Republic of Ireland outside of Dublin.
			In my 4 years in the role I have delivered year on year growth desipte facing unprecedneted market challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic, while also increase my territory market share from 20% to its current dominant 45% position.
			Having realised the need to adapt to the constanlty developing job market I realised the need to upskill, specifically within the field of sfotware development and wed design. With this in mind I recently enrolled on a higher diploma in Computer Science to advance these skills which will assist my current goal of moving into a marketing orientated role within the company.
